# Info
My first attempt at multi-threading with rust, allowing you to generate PI with arbitrary precision, and even search for sequences of digits. It also visualizes PI
with a histogram and line-graph. All of this was made possible by this excellent imgui port [imgui-rs](https://github.com/imgui-rs/imgui-rs) and of course, the 
incredible [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), both of which are absolutely fantastic pieces of software.
